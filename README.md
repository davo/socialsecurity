# Social Security Old Age Benefits Explained Visually

### Steps to run (for Dennys)
+ navigate to directory and type npm install (first time only)
+ ```npm run start ```
+ go to ```localhost:3000``` in your browser
+ to edit, navigate to ```src/components/App/App.js``` for the code. This is written with JSX so it looks like a bunch of html template. Go to ```src/components/App/styleApp.scss``` for the SASS style file. I am using CSS Modules so class names are like ```className={style.earnings}```. So it won't have a class name of like "earnings" but rather the earnings property on the style object.
